  <h2 id="sec-nsdoc">The Counter Ontology Vocabulary Description</h2>

  <p>This specification serves as the FOAF "namespace document". As
  such it describes the FOAF vocabulary and the terms (<a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> classes and properties) that
  constitute it, so that <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> applications can
  use those terms in a variety of RDF-compatible document formats
  and applications.</p>

  <p>This document presents FOAF as a <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> vocabulary or
  <em>Ontology</em>. The FOAF vocabulary is pretty simple,
  pragmatic and designed to allow simultaneous deployment and
  extension. FOAF is intended for widescale use, but its authors
  make no commitments regarding its suitability for any particular
  purpose.</p>

  <h3 id="sec-evolution">Evolution and Extension of FOAF</h3>

  <p>The FOAF vocabulary is identified by the namespace URI
  '<code>http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/</code>'. Revisions and
  extensions of FOAF are conducted through edits to this document,
  which by convention is accessible in the Web via the namespace URI.
  For practical and deployment reasons, note that <b>we do not 
  update the namespace URI as the vocabulary matures</b>.
  </p>

<p>
  The evolution of FOAF is best considered in terms of the
  stability of individual vocabulary terms, rather than the
  specification as a whole. As terms stabilise in usage and
  documentation, they progress through the categories
  '<strong>unstable</strong>', '<strong>testing</strong>' and
  '<strong>stable</strong>'. Older terms are marked '<strong>archaic</strong>' which allows the possibility of older forms to become modern again.</p><!--STATUSINFO-->
  </div>

  <p>...although of course change the <em>URL</em> to point to your
  own FOAF document. See also: more on <a href=
  "http://web.archive.org/web/20040416181630/rdfweb.org/mt/foaflog/archives/000041.html">FOAF
  autodiscovery</a> and services that make use of it.</p>

  <h2 id="sec-foafandrdf">FOAF and RDF</h2>

  <p>Why does FOAF use <a href=
  "http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>?</p>

  <p>FOAF is an application of the Resource Description Framework
  (RDF) because the subject area we're describing -- people -- has
  so many competing requirements that a standalone format could not
  do them all justice. By using RDF, FOAF gains a powerful
  extensibility mechanism, allowing FOAF-based descriptions can be
  mixed with claims made in <em>any other RDF vocabulary</em>.</p>

  <p>In summary then, RDF is self-documenting in ways which enable
  the creation and combination of vocabularies in a decentralised
  manner. This is particularly important for a vocabulary which
  describes people, since people connect to many other domains of
  interest and activity, and a single project cannot possibly cover everything.
</p>


  <h2 id="sec-crossref">FOAF cross-reference: Listing FOAF Classes and
  Properties</h2>

  <p>FOAF introduces the following classes and properties. There is a link at the 
top of this document to the RDF/XML version.</p>

  <!-- the following is the script-generated list of classes and properties -->
 

<!-- this is the a-z listing -->
%s

<!-- and this is the bulk of the vocab descriptions -->
%s


<h2 id="sec-extrefs">External Vocabulary References</h2>

<p>
The description of the terms in the FOAF 'dictionary' often make reference to classes and properties elsewhere. This section of the FOAF 
specification provides a placeholder reference for any FOAF mention of externally defined terms. For example, sometimes we might say that FOAF property has 
a domain or range of an externally defined class, or that a FOAF class is a sub-class of an external class, or 'disjoint with' such a class (ie. has no 
common members). Such claims help fix the intended meaning of FOAF terms in relationship to other 'peer' vocabularies. 
</p>


<h3 id="extns_status">Status Vocabulary</h3>

<p>
Each term in FOAF is annotated with properties from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/note">SemWeb Vocab Status Ontology</a>
</p>

<p>
This was created as an experiment in documenting FOAF's term-centric versioning model, in which a common fixed namespace URI is used, while 
term definitions slowly and independently evolve through different stability levels. This contrasts with other approaches to versioning which
attach versioning information to larger sets of terms.
</p>
<p>
Note that this mechanism is itself somewhat experimental and evolvin. The definitions of 'stable', 'unstable', 'archaic' and 'testing' cannot
 be defined as global absolutes, but only in relationship to the practices, expectations and social structures around some vocabulary. For their use in 
 FOAF, future versions of this specification could usefully offer more detail about what to expect from a term labelled 'stable'. 
 </p>

<dl>
<dt>vs:term_status</dt>
<dd>The vs:term_status property indicates the status of a vocabulary term, one of 'stable','unstable','testing' or 'archaic'. </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="extns_w3ccore">RDF Vocabulary Description - core concepts</h3>

<p>
The FOAF dictionary of terms is defined using a family of W3C standards: RDF, RDF Schema and OWL. These share a data model and general approach, and 
provide for increasing levels of expressivity. Here we introduce the core OWL and RDF/S terms used directly in the machine-readable description of FOAF. See 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">W3C's site</a> for the latest and most authoritative OWL and RDF specifications.
</p>

<p>
FOAF is based on the exchange of free-form descriptions that are structured in terms of things having properties, where the value of each property is 
expressed as either textually (eg. a name or number), or by reference to another thing. FOAF (as an application of RDF) uses URI identifiers wherever 
possible to talk about things of interest, whether they are Web pages, classes of thing, properties of things, or even people. See the W3C Web Architecture specification for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#identification">more background on URIs</a>.
</p>
<p>
From core RDF, FOAF takes the notion that we are talking about things, and they fall into categories; we call these 'classes'. The core machinery we 
use from the RDF Schema and OWL technologies simply give us some built-in terminology for talking about things, classes and properties. Here we introduce
some of these and discuss briefly how they relate to FOAF's approach to describing things.
</p>

<dl>
<dt id="term_Thing">owl:Thing</dt>
<dd>OWL introduces the class 'Thing' as a name for the universal class of all things. This is sometimes useful when
we want to express universality of property use, eg. that anything can be the value of <a href="#term_depicts">foaf:depicts</a>.</dd>
<dt>rdf:Property</dt>
<dd>RDF has a built-in class called rdf:Property. This is the class of all things like foaf:homepage or dc:creator which define named kinds of 
relationship between pairs of things, or between things and textually-expressed information.</dd>
<dt>owl:DatatypeProperty</dt>
<dd>The OWL specifications give a name for those properties whose values are textually-expressed: "DataTypeProperty". RDF allows these to be either plain literal values (these can also carry an indicator of their language, via xml:lang), or else "data-typed", which means they are marked with a URI indicating 
their type (but no language tagging).</dd>
<dt>owl:ObjectProperty</dt>
<dd>ObjectProperty is OWL's name for those properties which are not textually-expressed; instead, they are used when mentioning or referring to 
some other thing. OWL encourages vocabularies to avoid using a single named property in both 'ObjectProperty' and 'DataTypeProperty' styles. However
earlier usage, notably in the Dublin Core community, does just this. Each FOAF property is either an Object Property or DataType Property.
</dd>
<dt>rdf:type</dt>
<dd>One of the most commonly used built-in relationships in RDF is 'type'. RDF type relates something to a class that it is in.</dd>
<dt>rdfs:subClassOf</dt>
<dd>RDFS gives a name for the relationship between some specific class and its more general superclass: 'subClassOf'. It would have perhaps been 
simpler if this was called 'superProperty'. So for example we say that foaf:Person has an rdfs:subClassOf property whose value is foaf:Agent.
</dd>


<dt>rdfs:Class</dt>
<dd>RDFS gives the name 'Class' to those things that represent classes of thing, ie. which are values of rdf:type for their members. The 
OWL language also (for technical reasons) defines owl:Class for essentially the same notion. OWL also includes powerful machinery for defining the 
membership rules for classes. This is not heavily used in FOAF, beyond the experimental mechanisms associated with foaf:Group.
</dd>

<dt>rdfs:subClassOf</dt>
<dd>RDFS gives a name for the relationship between some particular class and its more general superclass: 'subClassOf'. It would have perhaps been 
simpler if this was called 'superProperty'. So for example we say that foaf:Person has a subPropertyOf property whose value is foaf:Agent.
</dd>


<dt>rdfs:subPropertyOf</dt>
<dd>Similar to subClassOf but for hierarchies of properties, we can use rdfs:subPropertyOf to point to a more general super-property, for example
we say foaf:aimChatID rdfs:subPropertyOf foaf:nick.
</dd>

<dt>rdfs:domain</dt>
<dd>The RDFS specification introduced the notion of a property's domain. This is a way of saying, for some property, something about the 
kind of classes it is used with. If you know the domain or domains for some property, you know that whenever you see that property applied to something,
then that thing ought to be a member of those classes. Note that this does not mean that every description using the property is compelled to mention
all those classes, just that the meaning of the property implies also the type of the thing the property is applied to. 
</dd>
<dt>rdfs:range</dt>
<dd>RDFS also defines a property of properties called 'range'; this works just like rdfs:domain, except for the values of a property. If you know the
range of some property, you know what kinds of thing are reasonable values for it.
</dd>
<dt>owl:FunctionalProperty</dt>
<dd>OWL provides even more useful information about properties, such as the ability to say that a property is 'functional'. This means simply that
for any particular thing, you can expect at most one value for that property. It is simplest to think of this as 
contextualised to any given time; although OWL doesn't talk about time explicitly. So we might say that 'age' is functional, even though a series of 
FOAF documents might be published, each truthfully giving different values for my 'age' which made sense in their original context. At the time of 
writing, the only W3C technology that can take a larger perspective on such different perspectives / views (or 'graphs') is SPARQL. If you have two 
different values for a given functional property, you know you have a problem; perhaps one is out-of-date, for example. Or perhaps they only differ in
trivial detail (eg. date syntax, whitespace). 
</dd>
<dt>owl:InverseFunctionalProperty</dt>
<dd>
OWL also gives a name for properties where common values tell us something about the identity of the thing having the property. On the Web this
can be very useful. OWL tells us that two descriptions are of the same thing, if they include truthful mention of some 'inverse functional property'
that has the same value. The classic FOAF example could be two mentions of a person having some particular foaf:homepage. This OWL construct is very useful for reasoning about identity and merging scattered and partial descriptions.
</dd>

<dt>owl:inverseOf</dt>
<dd>OWL provides a property 'inverseOf' that holds between inverse properties; for example, any two things related by foaf:maker are related in 
the reverse direction by foaf:made.</dd>
